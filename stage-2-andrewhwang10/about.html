                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p class="font-weight-light about">
                    Homelessness is a growing social issue in the city of Seattle. According to the Seattle.gov
                    <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/humanservices/about-us/initiatives/addressing-homelessness">statement</a>,
                    there is a growing trend of people who are homeless in the city of Seattle. In 2018, the city of Seattle
                    used a total budget of $77.6 million dollars on responding to the problem of homelessness. Despite this large
                    sum of money being spent to address homelessness, the needs are steadily outpacing the resources used. As a
                    social problem, homelessness is multifaceted and complex, both in addressing it and understanding it. The city
                    of Seattle believes that some of the factors contributing to homelessness are: increased cost of living, income
                    loss, prior criminal justice involvement, and education and employment gaps.
                </p>
                <p class="font-weight-light about">     
                    Around campus, there is significant presence of homeless populations. Regardless of the relevance
                    and proximity of the problem of homelessness, university students aren't equipped with knowledge and tools of
                    engagement, through the institution. Due to the lack of proper engagement within the institution, there is lack of
                    proper knowledge of homelessness and ways to engage with it. Using technology, specifically web application,
                    students and the university can have a centralized platform to engage with homelessness.

                <h2>How this works</h2>
                <p class="font-weight-light about">
                    This web platform would allow users to donate resources to local shelters and volunteer groups. In addition,
                    it would allow these shelter and groups to ask for specific resources they are in need of, which would help
                    resources flow in the appropriate direction. A common problem students have is the need to spend dining resources
                    by the end of the school year. This can also be addressed by allowing a way to use funds in a directed effort.
